This repository holds my code and report and presentation for the final project of LT2326.

Notebook 1 : ''' bash image captions.ipynb  '''
Notebook 2 : ''' bash VQA VizWiz.ipynb '''

The notebooks contain documentation for most of the functions so that can help you with understanding the code. The notebooks are to be run in order in some cases there are 2 functions with the same name 
because they are different experiments. For example, preprocess_img in that case you need to run one of the two so they don't overwrite each other.

The saved models were too big for github if needed please ask them from me.
